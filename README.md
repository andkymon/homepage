# Homepage: Joseph Joestar

This is a portfolio homepage for Joseph Joestar, the main character of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency. This project was created to practice mobile-first responsive web design, ensuring proper layouts across mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts.

Additionally, accessibility was a key focus as well:
- All interactive elements are focusable and keyboard-navigable.
- Image links have descriptive alt text indicating where they lead.
- Images include meaningful alt text when necessary.
